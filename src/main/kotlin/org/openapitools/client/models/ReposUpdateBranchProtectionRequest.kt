 * @param requiredStatusChecks 
 * @param enforceAdmins Enforce all configured restrictions for administrators. Set to `true` to enforce required status checks for repository administrators. Set to `null` to disable.
 * @param requiredPullRequestReviews 
 * @param restrictions 
 * @param requiredLinearHistory Enforces a linear commit Git history, which prevents anyone from pushing merge commits to a branch. Set to `true` to enforce a linear commit history. Set to `false` to disable a linear commit Git history. Your repository must allow squash merging or rebase merging before you can enable a linear commit history. Default: `false`. For more information, see \"[Requiring a linear commit history](https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/requiring-a-linear-commit-history)\" in the GitHub Help documentation.
 * @param allowForcePushes Permits force pushes to the protected branch by anyone with write access to the repository. Set to `true` to allow force pushes. Set to `false` or `null` to block force pushes. Default: `false`. For more information, see \"[Enabling force pushes to a protected branch](https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-force-pushes-to-a-protected-branch)\" in the GitHub Help documentation.\"
 * @param allowDeletions Allows deletion of the protected branch by anyone with write access to the repository. Set to `false` to prevent deletion of the protected branch. Default: `false`.

 * @param blockCreations If set to `true`, the `restrictions` branch protection settings which limits who can push will also block pushes which create new branches, unless the push is initiated by a user, team, or app which has the ability to push. Set to `true` to restrict new branch creation. Default: `false`.
 * @param requiredConversationResolution Requires all conversations on code to be resolved before a pull request can be merged into a branch that matches this rule. Set to `false` to disable. Default: `false`.
 * @param lockBranch Whether to set the branch as read-only. If this is true, users will not be able to push to the branch. Default: `false`.
 * @param allowForkSyncing Whether users can pull changes from upstream when the branch is locked. Set to `true` to allow fork syncing. Set to `false` to prevent fork syncing. Default: `false`.
