 * @param tree Objects (of `path`, `mode`, `type`, and `sha`) specifying a tree structure.
 * @param baseTree The SHA1 of an existing Git tree object which will be used as the base for the new tree. If provided, a new Git tree object will be created from entries in the Git tree object pointed to by `base_tree` and entries defined in the `tree` parameter. Entries defined in the `tree` parameter will overwrite items from `base_tree` with the same `path`.

If not provided, GitHub will create a new Git tree object from only the entries defined in the `tree` parameter. If you create a new commit pointing to such a tree, then all files which were a part of the parent commit's tree and were not defined in the `tree` parameter will be listed as deleted by the new commit.
